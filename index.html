</n> "Youth is a lie. It is nothing but evil.
Those of you, who rejoice in youth, are perpetually deceiving yourselves and
those around you. You perceive everything about the reality surrounding you in a
positive light. Even if you make a life-threatening mistake, it would still be seen as
proof of your youth- etched into a single page of your recollections.
I’ll give you an example. If such people are to dabble in criminal acts such as
shoplifting or mass rioting, it would be called ‘youthful indiscretion’. If they fail an
exam, they would claim that school is not only a place for studying. So long as
they are in the face of ‘youth’, they’ll be showcasing a distortion of any commonly
held beliefs or social norms.
Under their discretion, lies, secrets, crimes and even failure are nothing but the
spice of one’s youth. And in their corrupt ways, they discover something peculiar
about failure. They conclude that while their own failures are generally a part of
relishing in youth, others’ failures should be shot down as just failures and
nothing more.
If failure could be seen as proof of one's youth, wouldn’t it be strange not to
consider those who fail to make friends as experiencing the height of their
youth? Of course, they wouldn’t acknowledge it.
It amounts to nothing. The whole thing is nothing but a result of their
opportunism. Therefore, it is a sham. Full of lies, deception, secrets and fraud that
ought to be condemned.
They are evil.
That is to say, ironic as it is, those who do not glorify their youth are the truly
righteous ones."
